This code will work for an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and is designed to be used with a Fluid'O'Tech FG304 gear pump. To use with other Arduinos, remove the "matrix" references (referring to the LED matrix on an Uno R4). Additionally, if your Arduino has no DAC, you will need to change the code referencing DAC to a PWM pin and reference it instead. There should be no difference in the pump speed between DAC and PWM values.

PCBs, mechanical parts and wiring kits are in the works now and will be available for purchase from WE Coffee Co to make installation very easy. 

Any 1/4" BSP 0-200 PSI pressure sensor should work well. This is the one I'm using:

Flow meter is a standard Gicar flow meter with the 1.15 mm jet. If you have a different version, an adjustment to the calculations will be required. This is the one I'm using:
