This code will work for an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi. To use with other Arduinos, remove the "matrix" references (referring to the LED matrix on an Uno R4). Additionally, if your Arduino has no DAC, you will need to change the code referencing DAC to a PWM pin and reference it instead. There should be no difference in the pump speed between DAC and PWM values.

More info coming soon!
