This is the W.E. Coffee Co. gear pump controller software, designed for an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi. To use with other Arduinos, some fixes to the code may be required. 

It is designed to be used with a Fluid'O'Tech FG304 gear pump. Contact us if you'd like a new but unwarrantied FG304 (bought a lot of these when I found them at a discount).

A 2021 Acaia Lunar will automatically connect to the Arduino using this software package, but the 7" touchscreen will not (see Rev2 for that). Make sure the Lunar firmware is up to date using the Acaia Updater app. NOTE: After uploading the code to the Arduino, make sure to do a full power down or the Lunar will not connect. Do not just upload and wait for a reset - a power cycle is required after this!

PCBs, a wireless ESP32 screen with a full UI, mechanical parts, wiring kits and hydraulics kits are in the works. This is still a work in progress and getting it to all work together has been a major undertaking.

More info coming soon!
