This code will work for an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and is designed to be used with a Fluid'O'Tech FG304 gear pump. Contact me if you'd like a new but unwarrantied FG304 (bought a lot of these whhen I found them at a discount): jared.bandel@colorado.edu.

To use with other Arduinos, some fixes to the code may be required.

A 2021 Acaia Lunar will automatically connect to the Arduino. Make sure the Lunar firmware is up to date using the Acaia Updater app.

NOTE: After uploading the code to the Arduino, make sure to do a full power down or the Lunar will not connect. Do not just upload and wait for a reset - a power cycle is required after this!

PCBs, a wireless ESP32 screen with a full UI, mechanical parts, wiring kits and hydraulics kits are in the works. This is still a work in progress and getting it to all work together has been a major undertaking.

More info coming soon!
