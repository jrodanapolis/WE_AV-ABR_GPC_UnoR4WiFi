This is the W.E. Coffee Co. gear pump controller software, designed for an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and the Gear Pump Controller PCB (coming soon).

It is designed to be used with a Fluid'O'Tech FG304 gear pump. Contact me (Jared.Bandel@gmail.com) if you'd like a new but unwarrantied FG304 for $300 (bought a lot of these when I found them at a discount).

A 2021 Acaia Lunar will automatically connect to the Arduino using this software package. Make sure the Lunar firmware is up to date using the Acaia Updater app. NOTE: After uploading the code to the Arduino, make sure to do a full power down or the Lunar will not connect. Do not just upload and wait for a reset - a power cycle is required after this!

PCBs, mechanical parts (paddle assembly for EMP mode and pump bracket), wiring kits and hydraulics kits are in the works. Getting everything to work together has been a major undertaking!
